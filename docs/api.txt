The API
=======

After you've got your ``TaggableManager`` added to your model you can start
playing around with the API.


add(*tags)
~~~~~~~~~~

This adds tags to an object, the tags can be either ``Tag`` instances, or
strings::

    >>> apple.tags.all()
    []
    >>> apple.tags.add("red", "green", "fruit")


remove(*tags)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Removes a tag from an object, no exception is raised if the object doesn't have
that tag.

clear()
~~~~~~~

Removes all tags from an object.

set(*tags)
~~~~~~~~~~

Removes all the current tags and then adds the specified tags to the object.

most_common()
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Returns a ``QuerySet`` of all tags, annotated with the number of times they
appear, available as the ``num_times`` attribute on each tag.  The ``QuerySet``
is ordered by ``num_times``, descending.  The ``QuerySet`` is lazily evaluated,
and can be sliced efficiently.
