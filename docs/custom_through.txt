Using a Custom Through Model
============================

By default ``django-taggit`` uses a "through model" with a ``GenericForeignKey``
on it.  However, there are some cases where this isn't desirable, for example
if you want the speed and referential guarntees of a real ``ForeignKey``, or if
you have a model with a non-integer primary key.  In these cases ``django-taggit``
makes it easy to subsistute your own through model.

You must create your own intermediary model, a subclass of
``taggit.models.TaggedItemBase`` with a foreign key to your content model named
``content_object``, and then pass this intermediary model as the ``through``
argument of ``TaggableManager``::

    from django.db import models

    from taggit.managers import TaggableManager
    from taggit.models import TaggedItemBase

    
    class TaggedFood(TaggedItemBase):
        content_object = models.ForeignKey('Food')
    
    class Food(models.Model):
        # ... fields here

        tags = TaggableManager(through=TaggedFood)


Once this is done, the API works identically with direct-tagged or
GFK-tagged models.
